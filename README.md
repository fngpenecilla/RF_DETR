# RF_DETR
building an object detection system using the RF-DETR (Receptive Field Enhanced Detection Transformer) model. RF-DETR is an advanced object detection model that allows a better detection performance to small or complex objects while maintaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization and simplicity.
