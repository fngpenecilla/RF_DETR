# RF_DETR
This project focuses on building an object detection system using the RF-DETR (Receptive Field Enhanced Detection Transformer) model. RF-DETR is an advanced object detection model that allows a better detection performance to small or complex objects while maintaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization and simplicity.

Aquarium Dataset from Roboflow
- contains 1,255 high-quality images of marine life
- 8 distinct classes including fish, jellyfish, penguins, puffins, sharks, starfish, and stingrays.
- 1,171 training samples and 84 test samples.
This dataset suits mechanism research for attention because it features diverse aquatic species with varying sizes, colors, textures, and shapes. The visual complexity and diversity of marine environments provide an excellent testbed for comparing how different attention mechanisms handle various visual features like fine details, large-scale patterns, and complex backgrounds
